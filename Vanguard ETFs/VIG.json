            "page_text": "This example does not include the brokerage commissions that you may pay to\nbuy and sell ETF Shares of the Fund.\nPortfolio Turnover\nThe Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells\nsecurities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may\nindicate higher transaction costs and may result in more taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund\noperating expenses or in the previous expense example, reduce the Fund’s\nperformance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund’s portfolio turnover\nrate was 11% of the average value of its portfolio.\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\nThe Fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the\nperformance of the S&P U.S. Dividend Growers Index (the Index), which consists\nof common stocks of companies that have a record of increasing dividends over\ntime. The Fund attempts to replicate the target index by investing all, or\nsubstantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the Index, holding each\nstock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the Index. The\nFund may become nondiversified, as defined under the Investment Company Act\nof 1940, solely as a result of an index rebalance or market movement.\nPrincipal Risks\nAn investment in the Fund could lose money over short or long periods of time.\nYou should expect the Fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a\nwide range. The Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the\nFund’s performance:\n• Stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline.\nStock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of\nfalling prices. The Fund’s target index tracks a subset of the U.S. stock market,\nwhich could cause the Fund to perform differently from the overall stock market.\nIn addition, the Fund’s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a\nparticular market sector, which would subject the Fund to proportionately higher\nexposure to the risks of that sector.\n• Investment style risk, which is the chance that returns from dividend-paying\nstocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. In addition,\nmid-capitalization stocks (to the extent that the Fund’s assets are invested in\nmid-cap stocks) historically have been more volatile in price than the large-cap\nstocks that dominate the overall stock market. Dividend-paying stocks tend to go\nthrough cycles of doing better—or worse— than the stock market in general.\nThese periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.\n• Index-related risks. The Fund is subject to risks associated with index\ninvesting, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index\nprovider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the Fund’s use of an\nindexing strategy will negatively impact the Fund’s performance. Because the\n2\n"

            "page_text": "Fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that\nindex is performing, the Fund’s performance may be lower than it would be if the\nFund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the Fund’s\nperformance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error\nrisk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other\nunusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the Fund will be\nnegatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains,\nlosses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index\nprovider will generally be borne by the Fund and, as a result, the\nFund’s shareholders.\n• Index replicating risk, which is the chance that the Fund may be prevented\nfrom holding one or more securities in the same proportion as in its target index.\n• Nondiversification risk. By tracking its broad-based Index, the Fund may\nbecome nondiversified, as defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940,\nsolely as a result of an index rebalance or market movement. Nondiversified\nfunds invest a greater percentage of their assets in a small number of issuers\nthan diversified funds, which means their performance may be negatively\nimpacted by relatively few stocks, or even a single stock, and their shares may\nexperience significant fluctuations in value.\n• Index concentration risk. Except as may be necessary to approximate the\ncomposition of its Index, the Fund will not concentrate its investments in the\nsecurities of issuers whose principal business activities are in the same industry\nor group of industries. If the Index becomes concentrated and the Fund needs to\nconcentrate in the same industry or group of industries, its performance may be\nnegatively impacted by the industry or industries in which it is concentrated.\nBecause ETF Shares are traded on an exchange, they are subject to\nadditional risks:\n• The Fund’s ETF Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca and are bought\nand sold on the secondary market at market prices. Although it is expected that\nthe market price of an ETF Share typically will approximate its net asset value\n(NAV), there may be times when the market price and the NAV differ significantly.\nThus, you may pay more or less than NAV when you buy ETF Shares on the\nsecondary market, and you may receive more or less than NAV when you sell\nthose shares.\n• Although the Fund’s ETF Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, it is\npossible that an active trading market may not be maintained.\n• Trading of the Fund’s ETF Shares may be halted by the activation of individual\nor marketwide trading halts (which halt trading for a specific period of time when\nthe price of a particular security or overall market prices decline by a specified\npercentage). Trading of the Fund’s ETF Shares may also be halted if (1) the\nshares are delisted from NYSE Arca without first being listed on another\nexchange or (2) NYSE Arca officials determine that such action is appropriate in\nthe interest of a fair and orderly market or for the protection of investors.\n3\n"
