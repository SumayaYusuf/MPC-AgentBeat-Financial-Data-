            "page_text": "This example does not include the brokerage commissions that you may pay to\nbuy and sell ETF Shares of the Fund.\nPortfolio Turnover\nThe Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells\nsecurities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may\nindicate higher transaction costs and may result in more taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund\noperating expenses or in the previous expense example, reduce the Fund’s\nperformance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund’s portfolio turnover\nrate was 18% of the average value of its portfolio.\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\nThe Fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the\nperformance of the S&P Global Ex-U.S. Dividend Growers Index (the Index),\nwhich focuses on common stocks of high-quality companies located in\ndeveloped and emerging markets, excluding the United States, that have both\nthe ability and the commitment to grow their dividends over time. The Fund\nattempts to replicate the target index by investing all, or substantially all, of its\nassets in the collection of securities that make up the Index, holding each stock\nin approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the Index.\nPrincipal Risks\nAn investment in the Fund could lose money over short or long periods of time.\nYou should expect the Fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a\nwide range. The Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the\nFund’s performance:\n• Stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline.\nStock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of\nfalling prices. The Fund’s investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S.\nstock investments. Foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S.\nstocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in\nopposite directions. In addition, the Fund’s target index may, at times, become\nfocused in stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the Fund to\nproportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector.\n• Country/regional risk, which is the chance that world events—such as political\nupheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value\nof securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the\nFund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in\nany one country or region, the Fund’s performance may be hurt\ndisproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area.\nCountry/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.\n• Emerging markets risk, which is the chance that the stocks of companies\nlocated in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially\nless liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign\nmarkets because, among other factors, emerging markets can have greater\n2\n"

Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.\n• Investment style risk, which is the chance that returns from dividend-paying\nstocks will trail returns from global stock markets. Dividend-paying stocks tend to\ngo through cycles of doing better—or worse—than the global markets in general.\nThese periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.\n• Index-related risks. The Fund is subject to risks associated with index\ninvesting, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index\nprovider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the Fund’s use of an\nindexing strategy will negatively impact the Fund’s performance. Because the\nFund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that\nindex is performing, the Fund’s performance may be lower than it would be if the\nFund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the Fund’s\nperformance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error\nrisk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other\nunusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the Fund will be\nnegatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains,\nlosses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index\nprovider will generally be borne by the Fund and, as a result, the\nFund’s shareholders.\n• Index replicating risk, which is the chance that the Fund may be prevented\nfrom holding one or more securities in the same proportion as in its target index.\n• Asset concentration risk, which is the chance that, because the Fund’s target\nindex (and therefore the Fund) tends to be heavily weighted in its ten largest\nholdings, the Fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor\nperformance of relatively few stocks.\nBecause ETF Shares are traded on an exchange, they are subject to\nadditional risks:\n• The Fund’s ETF Shares are listed for trading on Nasdaq and are bought and\nsold on the secondary market at market prices. Although it is expected that the\nmarket price of an ETF Share typically will approximate its net asset value (NAV),\nthere may be times when the market price and the NAV differ significantly. Thus,\nyou may pay more or less than NAV when you buy ETF Shares on the\nsecondary market, and you may receive more or less than NAV when you sell\nthose shares.\n• Although the Fund’s ETF Shares are listed for trading on Nasdaq, it is possible\nthat an active trading market may not be maintained.\n• Trading of the Fund’s ETF Shares may be halted by the activation of individual\nor marketwide trading halts (which halt trading for a specific period of time when\nthe price of a particular security or overall market prices decline by a specified\npercentage).
