            "page_text": "This example does not include the brokerage commissions that you may pay to\nbuy and sell ETF Shares of the Fund.\nPortfolio Turnover\nThe Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells\nsecurities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may\nindicate higher transaction costs and may result in more taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund\noperating expenses or in the previous expense example, reduce the Fund’s\nperformance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund’s portfolio turnover\nrate was 12% of the average value of its portfolio.\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\nThe Fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the\nperformance of the MSCI US Investable Market Index (IMI)/Materials 25/50 (the\nIndex), an index made up of stocks of large, mid-size, and small U.S. companies\nwithin the materials sector, as classified under the Global Industry Classification\nStandard (GICS). The GICS materials sector is made up of companies that\nmanufacture chemicals, construction materials, glass, paper, forest products, and\nrelated packaging products, as well as metals, minerals, and mining companies,\nincluding producers of steel.\nThe Fund attempts to replicate the target index by seeking to invest all, or\nsubstantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the Index, in order to\nhold each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in\nthe Index.\nPrincipal Risks\nAn investment in the Fund could lose money over short or long periods of time.\nYou should expect the Fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a\nwide range. The Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the\nFund’s performance:\n• Stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline.\nStock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of\nfalling prices. The Fund’s target index tracks a subset of the U.S. stock market,\nwhich could cause the Fund to perform differently from the overall stock market.\n• Sector risk, which is the chance that significant problems will affect a particular\nsector, or that returns from that sector will trail returns from the overall stock\nmarket. Daily fluctuations in specific market sectors are often more extreme or\nvolatile than fluctuations in the overall market. Because the Fund seeks to invest\nall, or substantially all, of its assets in the materials sector, the Fund’s\n2\n"

            "page_text": "performance largely depends—for better or for worse—on the general condition\nof that sector. Companies in the materials sector could be affected by, among\nother things, commodity prices, government regulation, inflation expectations,\nresource availability, and economic cycles. Sector risk is expected to be high for\nthe Fund.\n• Nondiversification risk, which is the chance that the Fund’s performance may\nbe hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks or\neven a single stock. The Fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it\nmay invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a small number\nof issuers as compared with diversified mutual funds. Because the Fund tends to\ninvest a relatively high percentage of its assets in its ten largest holdings,\nfluctuations in the market value of a single Fund holding could cause significant\nchanges to the Fund’s share price. Nondiversification risk is expected to be high\nfor the Fund.\n• Investment style risk, which is the chance that returns from the types of stocks\nin which the Fund invests will trail returns from the overall stock market. Small-,\nmid-, and large-cap stocks each tend to go through cycles of doing better or\nworse than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general.\nThese periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. Historically,\nsmall- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than large-cap\nstocks. The stock prices of small and mid-size companies tend to experience\ngreater volatility because, among other things, these companies tend to be more\nsensitive to changing economic conditions.\n• Index-related risks. The Fund is subject to risks associated with index\ninvesting, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index\nprovider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the Fund’s use of an\nindexing strategy will negatively impact the Fund’s performance. Because the\nFund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that\nindex is performing, the Fund’s performance may be lower than it would be if the\nFund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the Fund’s\nperformance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error\nrisk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other\nunusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the Fund will be\nnegatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains,\nlosses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index\nprovider will generally be borne by the Fund and, as a result, the\nFund’s shareholders.\n• Index replicating risk, which is the chance that the Fund may be prevented\nfrom holding one or more securities in the same proportion as in its target index.\n3\n"

Although it is expected that\nthe market price of an ETF Share typically will approximate its net asset value\n(NAV), there may be times when the market price and the NAV differ significantly.\nThus, you may pay more or less than NAV when you buy ETF Shares on the\nsecondary market, and you may receive more or less than NAV when you sell\nthose shares.\n• Although the Fund’s ETF Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, it is\npossible that an active trading market may not be maintained.\n• Trading of the Fund’s ETF Shares may be halted by the activation of individual\nor marketwide trading halts (which halt trading for a specific period of time when\nthe price of a particular security or overall market prices decline by a specified\npercentage). Trading of the Fund’s ETF Shares may also be halted if (1) the\nshares are delisted from NYSE Arca without first being listed on another\nexchange or (2) NYSE Arca officials determine that such action is appropriate in\nthe interest of a fair and orderly market or for the protection of investors.\nAn investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or\nguaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other\ngovernment agency.\nAnnual Total Returns\nThe following bar chart and table are intended to help you understand the risks of\ninvesting in the Fund. The bar chart shows how the performance of the Fund’s\nETF Shares (based on NAV) has varied from one calendar year to another over\nthe periods shown. The table shows how the average annual total returns of the\nETF Shares compare with those of the Fund’s target index and another\ncomparative index, which have investment characteristics similar to those of the\nFund. Keep in mind that the Fund’s past performance (before and after taxes)\ndoes not indicate how the Fund will perform in the future.
