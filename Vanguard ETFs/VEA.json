It illustrates the\nhypothetical expenses that you would incur over various periods if you were to\ninvest $10,000 in the Fund’s shares. This example assumes that the shares\nprovide a return of 5% each year and that total annual fund operating expenses\nremain as stated in the preceding table. You would incur these hypothetical\nexpenses whether or not you were to sell your shares at the end of the given\nperiod. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these\nassumptions your costs would be:\n1 Year\n3 Years\n5 Years\n10 Years\n$3\n$10\n$17\n$39\nThis example does not include the brokerage commissions that you may pay to\nbuy and sell ETF Shares of the Fund.\nPortfolio Turnover\nThe Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells\nsecurities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may\nindicate higher transaction costs and may result in more taxes when Fund shares\nare held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund\noperating expenses or in the previous expense example, reduce the Fund’s\nperformance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund’s portfolio turnover\nrate was 3% of the average value of its portfolio.\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\nThe Fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the\nperformance of the FTSE Developed All Cap ex US Index (the Index), a\nmarket-capitalization-weighted index that as of December 31, 2024, is made up\nof approximately 3,909 common stocks of large-, mid-, and small-cap companies\nlocated in Canada and the major markets of Europe and the Pacific region. The\nFund attempts to replicate the target index by investing all, or substantially all, of\nits assets in the stocks that make up the Index, holding each stock in\napproximately the same proportion as its weighting in the Index.\nPrincipal Risks\nAn investment in the Fund could lose money over short or long periods of time.\nYou should expect the Fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a\nwide range. The Fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the\nFund’s performance:\n2\n"

            "page_text": "• Stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline.\nStock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of\nfalling prices. The Fund’s investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S.\nstock investments. Foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S.\nstocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in\nopposite directions. In addition, the Fund’s target index may, at times, become\nfocused in stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the Fund to\nproportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector.\n• Country/regional risk, which is the chance that world events—such as political\nupheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value\nof securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the\nFund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in\nany one country or region, the Fund’s performance may be hurt\ndisproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area.\nSignificant investments in Japan and the United Kingdom (U.K.) subject the\nIndex and the Fund to proportionately higher exposure to Japanese and U.K.\ncountry risk.\n• Investment style risk, which is the chance that returns from non-U.S. small-\nand mid-capitalization stocks will trail returns from global stock markets.\nHistorically, non-U.S. small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price\nthan the large-cap stocks that dominate the global markets, and they often\nperform quite differently. The stock prices of small and mid-size companies tend\nto experience greater volatility because, among other things, these companies\ntend to be more sensitive to changing economic conditions.\n• Currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment,\nmeasured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in\ncurrency exchange rates.\n• Index-related risks. The Fund is subject to risks associated with index\ninvesting, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index\nprovider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the Fund’s use of an\nindexing strategy will negatively impact the Fund’s performance. Because the\nFund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that\nindex is performing, the Fund’s performance may be lower than it would be if the\nFund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the Fund’s\nperformance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error\nrisk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other\nunusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the Fund will be\nnegatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains,\nlosses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index\nprovider will generally be borne by the Fund and, as a result, the\nFund’s shareholders.\n3\n"

Although it is expected that\nthe market price of an ETF Share typically will approximate its net asset value\n(NAV), there may be times when the market price and the NAV differ significantly.\nThus, you may pay more or less than NAV when you buy ETF Shares on the\nsecondary market, and you may receive more or less than NAV when you sell\nthose shares.\n• Although the Fund’s ETF Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, it is\npossible that an active trading market may not be maintained.\n• Trading of the Fund’s ETF Shares may be halted by the activation of individual\nor marketwide trading halts (which halt trading for a specific period of time when\nthe price of a particular security or overall market prices decline by a specified\npercentage).

The bar chart shows how the performance of the Fund’s\nETF Shares (based on NAV) has varied from one calendar year to another over\nthe periods shown. The table shows how the average annual total returns of the\nETF Shares compare with those of the Fund’s target index and other\ncomparative indexes, which have investment characteristics similar to those of\nthe Fund. The Spliced Developed ex US Index reflects the performance of the\nFTSE Developed ex North America Index through December 20, 2015; the FTSE\nDeveloped All Cap ex US Transition Index through May 31, 2016; and the FTSE\nDeveloped All Cap ex US Index thereafter.
